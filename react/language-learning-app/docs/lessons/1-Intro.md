# The Japanese language

The Japanese langauge consists of 3 different writing script Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana, but Hiragana and Katakana are very similar. Japanese script uses less punctuation than most languages. Japanese is normally written without spaces between words, and the question mark is not used in formal or traditional Japanese writing. The Japanese language has its own version of the full stop (。) and comma (、), which are used similarly in English, though the full stop is often ommitted when a sentence stands alone.

## Kana

Kana consists of the two syllabaries: Hiragana and Katakana. The characters consist of consonant-vowel syllables, with the exception of the "n" character, and the vowels "a", "i", "u", "e" and "o". Both Hiragana and Katakana are used to write the same sounds, but they are used in different contexts.

#### Hiragana

Hiragana is mostly used for writing grammatical components, like particles and postpositions. The english equivalent of these are words like "with", "from" "to" etc. Another grammatical use of Hiragana is for verb and adjective endings. Hiragana is also sometimes used for writing words when the Kanji is obscure or difficult to read. Hiragana is also used as Furigana as a reading aid for Kanji, where the Hiragana is written above or beside the Kanji to help with reading of the Kanji. This is often used in children's books, books for people learning Japanese, or for obscure and uncommonly used Kanji.

#### Katakana

Katakana is primarily used for transliteraion of foreign words and names, such as "コーヒー" (kōhī) for "coffee", and for onomatopoeia. (The overbars in the o and i in kōhī indicate long vowels). Katakana can be used for emphasis, similar to how we use italics in English. Katakana is also used for writing scientific names of plants and animals, and for writing the names of plants and animals that are not native to Japan.

## Kanji

Kanji makes up the largest portion of the Japanese writing system. Kanji are logographic characters, meaning that each character represents a word or a morpheme. Eg. 私, _watashi_; I, me. Or 犬, _inu_; dog. Kanji are used for writing most nouns, verb, adjective and adverb stems, and personal and place names. Most Kanji have multiple readings, and the reading of a Kanji can change depending on the context. The readings of Kanji can be divided into two categories: On'yomi and Kun'yomi. On'yomi are the readings that were borrowed from Chinese, and Kun'yomi are the readings that were native to Japan.

## Rōmaji

Rōmaji is the romanization of the Japanese language, meaning the conversion of the Japanese script into the Latin alphabet. Rōmaji is used for teaching Japanese to non-native speakers, and for inputting Japanese into computers and sometimes phones (there are other ways to do this as well). Rōmaji in the middle of Japanese text stands out, so it is commonly used in corporate brands and commercials, where the use of Rōmaji is used to make the brand or product seem more modern and international. Rōmaji is also used for Latin-alphabet acronyms, and with Katakana for some foreign words, such as T-shirt, T シャツ, _tīshatsu_.
