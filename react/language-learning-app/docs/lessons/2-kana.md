# Kana

An alphabet is a set of letters or symbols that represent certain sounds or phonemes. The Kana scripts are instead syllabaries, where each character represents a syllable. The Kana scripts are Hiragana and Katakana.

Both of the Kana scripts have their origins in Kanji, and old Japanese was actually written entirely using these characters.
