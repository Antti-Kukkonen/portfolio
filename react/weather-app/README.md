## Target Users and Stakeholders:

- **Target Users**:
  - Travelers planning trips
  - Commuters checking weather conditions before leaving for work
  - Outdoor enthusiasts planning activities
  - Event organizers checking weather for outdoor events
  - (Really anyone going outside)
- **Stakeholders**:
  - This application isn't monetized, so there is no one with a vested interest in the project, apart from the developers.

## Main Functionality:

- **Display Weather Information**
  - Current temperature
  - General weather condition
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Cloudiness
- **Location-Based:** Allows users to enter a location (e.g. city name) to get weather information for that specific area.
- **Simple interface**
- **Responsive Design**
- **Unit Conversion**
- **Data Retrieval using the OpenWeatherMap API**

## User Stories:

- As a user, I need to enter a location (city or coordinates) in the app so that I can view the current weather conditions for that location.

- As a user, I need to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature, mph and km/h for wind speed) so that I can view the weather data in my preferred units.

- As a user, I need the option to view additional weather details such as humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and wind direction for the current weather so that I can get a comprehensive overview.

- As a user, I need the app to automatically detect and display the weather for my current location so that I don't have to manually enter my location every time I use the app.

- As a user, I need the option to save and manage a list of my favorite locations for quick access to their weather information so that I can easily check the weather for frequently visited places.

- As a user, I need the app to be responsive so that I can access and use it seamlessly on various devices, such as my smartphone, tablet, or computer.

- As a user, I need to receive a friendly error message if there is an issue with retrieving weather data or if I enter an invalid location so that I can understand and resolve the problem.
